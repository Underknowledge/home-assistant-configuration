## About

Its getting time to share my Home Assistant configuration, I gone a little crazy over the last year.

I run Hass.io on a around 4 year old i5 desktop pc wich is actually prittey beefy. The plan is to get a  [Openstack](https://docs.openstack.org/) running, but well... it bites back :P 

Used most of the time [packages](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/) but to clean up stuff I took [Frenck's](https://github.com/frenck) approach to go over every automation and package. 

be sure to hit the GitHub :star2:
